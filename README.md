# Leetcode
An auto-generated repository of all Leetcode problems which I completed. I really just wanted to have them all in one place, and figuring out how to encode the history properly was a nice challenge.

[Leetcode-Downloader-for-Submissions](https://github.com/world177/Leetcode-Downloader-for-Submissions) was used to acquire the relevant code and completion times. 

`main.py` then gathers the respective data from `./submissions/`, creates a git repository and creates the respective files and commits.
